# trac Code Challenge

## Intro

Inside each folder you'll find a README file containing the instructions for different challenges.
Each challenge is structured as follows:

- There is a goal (AKA: *what* you're building)
- There are a set of requirements (AKA: constraints on *how* you build it)
- There are a set grading guidelines. This is how we'll evaluate the Code Challenge

## Instructions

1. Fork this repo!
2. Pick one challenge from the root folder and solve it
3. Complete as many challenges as you want!
4. Share your solution with us

## What's next?

We'll contact you after reviewing your submission. Be ready for a show and tell describing your solution.
